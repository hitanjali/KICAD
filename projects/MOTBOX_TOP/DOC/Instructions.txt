General Instructions for all boards : 

1. The connectors are polarized hence can not be connected in any direction. In order to find the correct pins to solder : 

	a) Connect one end of the connector to the main PCB. 
	b) Note the GND or any specific pin marked on the connector. 
	c) Solder the marked pin [ GND or any other ] to the corresponding pin on the suppporting PCB. 
	d) Maintain the sequence. 

4. IR TX and IR RX boards look similar but there are connection differences. Need to take care of connecting TX and RX LEDs.
