Parse the XML file to generate an intermediate file a hash which will have no of pins for every one in the xml
	Read the XML file and till we get "<libparts>  # Marks the start of the process
	then read and match   -> <libpart lib=".*" part=".*"> string. 
		split the string with "part" to get the cmponent name variable. 

		Keep reading further to get the string alias and get the other components with the same number of pins 

			
	Now keep reading the file further and store n,n-1 lines till the line matches "</pins>" 
	     split the n-1 line with num= and get the number of pins
		
	else if the line matches with "<libpart>" 
		then the component does not have pins 


         Read the file till we get the line as "</libparts>" # Marking end of the process


Parse the BOM csv 
cmp_name = Get the Cmp Name filed for the component 
Read the intermediate file and get number of pins for it. And write the LC BOM file. 

else 
	do not write in LC BOM 
	write another report file whichc has part with no pins found
